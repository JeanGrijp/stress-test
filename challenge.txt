Goal: Create a Go CLI to run load tests against a web service. The user must provide the service URL, total number of requests, and level of concurrency.

The system must generate a report with specific information after the tests finish.

CLI parameters:

--url: URL of the target service.
--requests: Total number of requests.
--concurrency: Number of concurrent calls.

Test execution:

- Perform HTTP requests to the specified URL.
- Distribute requests according to the configured concurrency.
- Ensure the total number of requests is reached.

Report generation:

- Show a report at the end containing:
- Total execution time
- Total number of requests performed
- Number of requests with HTTP status 200
- Distribution of other HTTP status codes (e.g., 404, 500, etc.)

Running the application:
You can run this application via docker. Example:
docker run <your docker image> --url=http://google.com --requests=1000 --concurrency=10
